solve_d4a91cb9: 

Difficulty Level according to us : Easy to Medium

Logic :

The basic logic for solving this problem through the naked eye and to a layman 
person would be get the coordinates of the two colours ie sky blue and red.The 
values for these in our list is 2 and 8.And then connect the 2 points throug 
it's row and column by two lines of yellows till it intersects.

We used the numpy where function to find the coordinates of these points.The main 
problem in solving this issue was to find out in what direction the line has to be plotted.
For this we used the if else to determine if blue has higher column value or red.
Based on that we update the corresponding values in the given row and column to 4.

Basic python and numpy used.Was able to solve all inputs and outputs in the json 
file successfully.

solve_f5b8619d: 

Difficulty Level according to us : Easy

Logic :

On a first look it looked a little difficult to us.However we could quickly understand 
that it is a mirror effect after some basic changes to the inital array.
In the initial array we have to identify the columns where the value is non zero.
We have to change the value of all the rows for that column without touching the original 
values to 8.Once it is completed we have to mirror the array along the horizontal 
axis once and then the vertical axis once.This can be done interchangeably as well.

Basic python and numpy has been used.

All the test inputs and outputs were successfully validated and passed.

solve_0a938d79: 
    
Difficulty Level according to us : Easy 

We found Task 0a938d79 simple to understand and implement. Looking at task demonstration 
we can see alternate coloured line pattern repeats until end of array. If number of rows are 
more than the columns then line patterns are repeated until last row. If the number of 
columns are more than the rows then the line patterns are repeated until end of last column. 
Count for intermediate black rows are dependent on number of columns/rows between given 
two colour cells. 

Solver function checked shape of array, colours of non-black locations and loop through
the rows/columns until max number of rows/columns reached. Coloured locations/cells are
used as reference to paint the location to create the line in X or Y axis and new array
return after transformation. 

All training and test grids solved correctly.

solve_1a07d186(x)

Difficulty Level according to us : Medium to difficult 

We found Task 1a07d186 medium to be difficult. On the first look, task seems easy 
i.e. just moving the coloured cells adjacent to respective lines. But it is also important to 
identify line as object, move coloured cells in right direction and to remove other 
coloured cells which doesnâ€™t have coloured line present. The same logic then needs to be 
defined for vertical and horizontal lines (single/multiple).

We decided to implement the solver function with basic logic and with less use of 
library APIs. Numpy is used only where necessary, so the code looks big. It identified 
colour in array and marked the coordinates. Then identified the line object with traversing 
in X/Y axis from edge to edge to confirm the line position. Once all these information 
is available, then look for nearest line coordinate for coloured cell and paint next 
location in same row/column. The original colour location is then overwritten with black. 
In case of cells with colours other than line colour, the location is overwritten with black.  

All training and test grids solved correctly.

shape to fill the space with yellow colour. The logic which is applied here is same 
as previous task 1a07d186, instead of lines, here is to identify the space enclosed

Same logic of x, y location +/-1 for checking all coordinates around the coloured 
cell used. Code optimized with the use of list as queue and multiple conditions in loops.

Logic:
The idea behind solving this problem was to get the number of islands within a 
particular array.This was done through a depth first search.Once a particulat 
island is visited it is not counted twice.For this we created an internal functions 
called dfs.


After iterating through the entire array we found the number of islands.We then 
created a numpy zero array with the same dimensions as the number of islands.
We then update the diagonal of the array with the value 8.

We were able to succsfully validate and test all the inputs with their given outputs

def solve_4093f84a(x)


Difficulty Level  according to us : Medium to Difficult

Logic : 
4093f84a.json looked to be simple on the testing interface initially.Logically 
we needed to find the rectangle with 5's and then determine whether it was a horizontal 
one or a vertical one.After that close to the the rectangle  we had to fill the 5 in 
the respective rows or columns.

We tried to have a simple approach of finding the bigger island with the rectangle first.
After that we made all the other positions as zero.We noted the positions of the other 
values.And then added them to the rectangle in their respective rows and columns.

The given code use basic python and numpy functions.
While testing this it passed for the test demonstration 1.However there was a 
slight difference in demosntraions 2 and 3 as there were multiple non 5 values in the 
same row or column.This made it to not completely satisfy the outputs for 2 and 3 and test input grid.

The idea to solve this would be to get the positions ond the number of such colours 
in a particular row or column.Once we get the number we can add to the same side of 
the rectangle the cells and this would result in the success of the function

def solve_5ad4f10b(x)

Difficulty Level according to us : Difficult

Logic:

For solving 5ad4f10b.json we tried to look at various ways for coming up.It seemed 
a little difficult.The main challenge was to find the area for the section which was 
to be contracted and then the values updated with the other colour outliers.

Following is the approach we followed for this section :

1.Identify the n*n squares(start with 3) in the given array,their coordinates as 
well and store their values in separate lists.
2.Get the max and min values of the rows and column numbers for the areas containing squares.
3.Create a new array with only the rows and columns which  was obtained from Step 2
4.Clear any other colour values than 0 and the squares and convert it to 0.
5.Get the other colour value from the original array and create a new array with the specific positions.

We have used basic numpy and math library to get this output.

The one limitation to this part of the code is that it is currently useful for 
3*3 squares only(Training Input and output 2 currently. We can use a similar version of 
the same code by altering the for loops a little to make it working for 4*4 squares as well.
Due to timing limitations we have not tried it. However we believe the logic would be near 
about the same and would work for other training and test grids as well with slight modifications.

A short summary/reflection, commenting on the Python features and libraries you used in the solve * 

In first semester of MSc. while learning and working on assignments we could see maturity 
of available ML packages which can trained on different kind of tasks e.g., NLP task for 
suggestion mining or regression tasks for prediction of home prices etc. but while working 
with ARC, we realized that weâ€™re still very far away from building a human like intelligence. 
All the tasks (.JSON files) when looked in browser, one can identify the patterns in seconds 
just looking at few samples, but it is not easy for ML/programming to generalize this type 
of intelligence. We didnâ€™t find much help on generalised pattern recognition available, 
and ARC is an upcoming new topic in field of AI. We both found it is super interesting 
and addictive i.e., we initially though to just complete 3-4 patterns and submit the assignment 
but end up coding 8-9 patterns!

We did not use any ML package or specific libraries but used Numpy and pure python to 
translate our understanding of patterns into code. We found that, in future there can 
be few common functions/libraries be made to recognize the patterns e.g., find specific 
shape objects or enclosed spaces, highlight repetitive patterns, symmetry etc. or correlate 
the colours in base image to transformed image. These functions in addition to math 
libraries can be then basis for creating hypothesise in terms of hyper parameters or 
support functions. We still have limited understanding of this topic and acknowledge 
that writing the code to solve all sorts of problems i.e., generalisation is not easy 
task. 


Commonalities between the problems :

->Pattern Recognition is very important.
->Many problems include finding the position of enclosed areas and islands.
->In many problems we had dimensionality reshaping as well as revaluation of the array.
->Most of the problems can be solved via if else loops or basic libraray functions.
  However as mentioned before  there is no one off solution to all problems


Github has been thoroughly used by us for core sharing and working as a team of 2.
Readme file has been altered as well for reflecting the ARC understanding.

As mentioned by FranÃ§ois Chollet in his paper 'The Measure of Intelligence' the 
solutions can be generalised only to a limited extent because of some of the limitations 
which we could see while solving our given problems.The major limitations were a 
generalisation of the problem and limited set of inputs and outputs for training 
on the same problem. We could only test what was given to use.We are however aware 
that there will be many variations in the given formations.

No doubt there are still many leaps to be taken by Arificial Intelligence!
